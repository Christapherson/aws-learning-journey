## âœ… Completed
- Attempted CloudPath Level 4 (Lambda ARN)
- Learned about variable usage vs. string literals
- Debugging practice (quotes vs. variables)
- Requested CloudPath improvements for better learning experience

## ðŸ’¡ Learned Today
- Difference between print('variable') and print(variable)
- When to use quotes (literal text) vs. no quotes (variable values)
- Importance of asking questions when stuck
- How to debug by looking at expected vs. actual output

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
- Complete improved CloudPath with adaptive hints
- Finish CloudPath Levels 1-5
- Continue building Python fundamentals
- Commit daily progress to GitHub

## ðŸ’ª Growth Mindset
Getting stuck on Level 4 taught me more than breezing through would have. 
Asking "why doesn't this work?" is exactly how you learn programming.
