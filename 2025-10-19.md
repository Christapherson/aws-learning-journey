**Focus:** Understanding AWS EC2 concepts in preparation for Week 2 hands-on projects  
**Time Investment:** 90 minutes (9:30 PM - 11:00 PM)

## What I Learned

### EC2 Core Concepts

**What is EC2?**
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is AWS's virtual server service. Where S3 provides storage, EC2 provides compute power - actual servers that can run applications, process data, host websites, and execute code. The fundamental difference: S3 is a storage locker, EC2 is a workshop where work gets done.

**Instance Types and Families**
- **T-Series (Burstable):** t2.micro, t3.micro - General purpose, cost-effective, perfect for learning
- **M-Series (Balanced):** Balanced CPU/memory for consistent workloads
- **C-Series (Compute):** CPU-optimized for processing-heavy tasks
- **R-Series (Memory):** RAM-optimized for databases and caching

For my Week 2 projects, I'll use **t2.micro** (Free Tier eligible, 750 hours/month free) to learn Linux CLI navigation and AWS fundamentals while staying frugal.

### AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)

AMIs are blueprints for EC2 instances that determine the operating system, pre-installed software, and configurations. Common options include Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu Server, and Windows Server. I'll primarily use Amazon Linux 2023 for my projects since it's AWS-optimized and Free Tier eligible.

### Security Groups - The Virtual Firewall

Security Groups control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances (not to be confused with Network ACLs). Key principles:
- **Default behavior:** Deny all inbound, allow all outbound
- **Stateful:** Return traffic is automatically allowed
- **Configuration:** Define rules by protocol, port, and source IP
- **No cost:** Security Groups are free to create and modify

For web servers, I'll need to allow SSH (port 22) for management and HTTP (port 80) for web traffic.

### Key Pairs and SSH Access

Linux EC2 instances use SSH key-based authentication instead of passwords:
1. Create a key pair when launching an instance
2. Download the `.pem` private key file (cannot be recovered if lost)
3. Store securely in `~/.ssh/` with `chmod 400` permissions
4. Use `ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@instance-ip` to connect

### Instance Lifecycle States

**Stopping vs Terminating:**
- **Stopped:** Powered off, EBS data preserved, can restart later, charged only for EBS storage (~$0.10/GB/month)
- **Terminated:** Permanently deleted, all data lost (unless backed up), no charges, cannot be recovered

For cost management during my 90-day journey: **STOP** instances when not using them, **TERMINATE** when completely done with a project.

### Pricing Models

- **On-Demand:** Pay by the hour, ~$0.0116/hour for t3.micro (FREE for first 750 hours/month)
- **Reserved:** 40-60% discount for 1-3 year commitments (not relevant for learning)
- **Spot:** Up to 90% discount but can be terminated with 2-minute notice (not recommended for learning)

## Comprehension Check Results

To validate my understanding, I answered these four questions:

**1. What's the difference between S3 and EC2?**  
S3 is for storage (like a school locker), EC2 is for computing (like a workshop or muscles in a gym). S3 stores content, EC2 does the work.

**2. Which instance type will you use and why?**  
t2.micro for Free Tier eligibility and to learn Linux CLI navigation, which I'm admittedly weak at.

**3. What happens when you stop vs terminate an instance?**  
Stopping: Storage isn't ephemeral (EBS), charged only for EBS per month, can restart later. Terminating: No charges, but all data is lost forever unless backups were made, and hosted content disappears.

**4. What do Security Groups control?**  
Inbound and outbound traffic flow to/from EC2 instances. Default: deny inbound, allow outbound. You configure sources, port numbers, and IP addresses for inbound rules.

## Week 2 Preview

Based on tonight's study, I'm prepared to build:
- **Project 1:** Launch first EC2 instance with proper security group configuration
- **Project 2:** Deploy a web server (Apache/Nginx) and serve a simple website
- **Project 3:** Connect EC2 to S3 bucket using AWS CLI

## Reflection

This session felt like a solid refresher from my AWS certification studies. The difference between knowing concepts for an exam versus understanding them for hands-on implementation is becoming clearer. The "use it or lose it" principle is real - having these fundamentals fresh before building tomorrow will make the hands-on work much smoother.

**Key Takeaway:** Theory provides the map, but building provides the experience. Ready for Week 2.
