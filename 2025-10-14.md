# October 14, 2025 - Day 2

## âœ… Completed
- Python exercises 1-5 during work and after clock-out
- Practiced EC2 cost calculations with multiple instance types
- Learned variables, math operations, print statements with f-strings
- Stayed in flow state after work (gym off-day)
- 2+ hours of focused learning

## ðŸ’¡ Learned Today
- Python variables and how to store information
- Math operations (multiplication for cost calculations)
- F-strings for formatted output
- Real SA work: EC2 pricing comparisons
- How to add multiple instances to calculations

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Built
Exercise 1: AWS regions list
Exercise 2: EC2 cost calculator (4 instance types)
Exercise 3: S3 bucket naming practice
Exercise 4: Lambda ARN format
Exercise 5: Cost optimization calculations

## ðŸ’ª Challenges Overcome
- Initially confused about dictionaries vs. simple variables
- Learned that starting simple is better than jumping to advanced concepts
- Practiced incremental learning (master basics first, then level up)

## ðŸ”¥ Wins
- Coded during work breaks instead of wasting time
- Completed 5 exercises in one session
- Understanding Python fundamentals that apply to boto3
- Building toward real AWS automation
