# Day 4: Lists, Loops, and Conditional Logic
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Time:** 30 min (lunch) + 90 min (evening) = 2 hours  
**Focus:** Python fundamentals - lists, for loops, indexing, if/else logic

## Overview

Today marked a major breakthrough in my Python learning. I started the day still uncertain about lists and loops, but by evening I had written real infrastructure monitoring code that tracks server health and generates automated reports. The progression from lunch break experiments to evening's advanced exercises showed me that consistent practice, even in short sessions, creates real momentum.

## Lunch Session (2:55 PM - 3:25 PM)

I used my thirty-minute lunch break to preview concepts I'd be learning tonight. This turned out to be incredibly valuable because when I sat down for my evening session, my brain had already been primed with the basics.

I started with a simple variable review using AWS terminology to reinforce Day 3 concepts. Then I moved into my first real work with lists, learning that square bracket notation with indices lets you access specific items, and that Python uses zero-based indexing where the first item is at position zero.

My first for loop was challenging because I hit an indentation error in Terminal's interactive mode. After typing the for statement and seeing the three dots prompt, I forgot to press Tab before the print statement. The second attempt worked perfectly once I understood that indented code tells Python what actions belong inside the loop.

The most important lunch exercise involved using range with multiple lists simultaneously. I learned that when you write `for i in range(3)`, the variable i becomes a counter that goes through zero, one, and two, and you can use that counter to access corresponding positions in multiple lists at the same time. This let me pair instance types with their costs and print them together in formatted strings.

What really showed I was learning rather than just copying was when I experimented by changing range values to see what would happen. I tested `range(1)`, `range(2)`, and `range(3)` with the same code to understand that the number inside range determines how many loop iterations you get. This experimentation proved to me that I was thinking like a programmer, testing my understanding by modifying code and observing the results.

## Evening Session (7:30 PM - 9:00 PM)

### Exercise 1: S3 Storage Totals

I started the evening by completing the storage calculation challenge I ran out of time for during lunch. This exercise introduced running totals, which means tracking an accumulating value as the loop progresses.
```python
buckets = ['logs-bucket', 'data-bucket', 'backup-bucket']
sizes = [45, 230, 1200]

total = 0
for i in range(3):
    print(f"{buckets[i]}: {sizes[i]} GB")
    total = total + sizes[i]

print(f"Total storage used: {total} GB")
```

The key concept here is that total starts at zero, then with each loop iteration we add the current bucket's size to whatever we've accumulated so far. By the time the loop finishes, total contains the sum of all three bucket sizes, which came out to fourteen hundred seventy-five gigabytes. This pattern is fundamental for calculating aggregate metrics across AWS resources like total monthly costs or combined storage usage.

### Exercise 2: Budget Analysis with If/Else Logic

This exercise added decision-making inside loops, which took the complexity up significantly. Now instead of performing the same action on every item, the loop checks a condition and takes different actions based on what it finds.
```python
instances = ['web-server', 'database', 'cache-server', 'backup-server']
monthly_costs = [45.50, 120.00, 30.75, 200.00]
budget_limit = 100.00

print("Cost Analysis Report:")
print("=" * 40)

for i in range(4):
    if monthly_costs[i] > budget_limit:
        print(f"⚠️  {instances[i]}: ${monthly_costs[i]} - OVER BUDGET, WTF")
    else:
        print(f"✅ {instances[i]}: ${monthly_costs[i]} - within budget, good job")

print("=" * 40)
```

I personalized the messages because at this point I felt comfortable enough with the code to make it my own. The database server at one hundred twenty dollars and backup server at two hundred dollars both triggered the over-budget warnings, while web server and cache server stayed within the limit.

The indentation became trickier with three levels of nesting, but I worked through the errors by thinking structurally about which code belongs inside the loop, which code belongs inside the if or else branches, and which code runs after the loop completes.

### Exercise 3: EC2 Health Monitoring

The final exercise combined everything into a realistic monitoring system that tracks multiple statistics simultaneously.
```python
instances = ['web-01', 'web-02', 'db-01', 'cache-01', 'api-01']
cpu_usage = [45, 92, 78, 23, 95]
status_threshold = 80

print("EC2 Health Report")
print("=" * 50)

healthy_count = 0
critical_count = 0

for i in range(5):
    if cpu_usage[i] > status_threshold:
        print(f"🔴 CRITICAL: {instances[i]} - CPU at {cpu_usage[i]}%")
        critical_count = critical_count + 1
    else:
        print(f"🟢 HEALTHY: {instances[i]} - CPU at {cpu_usage[i]}%")
        healthy_count = healthy_count + 1

print("=" * 50)
print(f"Summary: {healthy_count} healthy, {critical_count} critical")
```

The output correctly identified web-02 at ninety-two percent and api-01 at ninety-five percent as critical, while the other three servers showed healthy status. The summary reported three healthy and two critical servers.

What makes this advanced is maintaining two separate counters that get incremented based on different conditions. This is production-grade monitoring logic that generates the kind of summary statistics you see in cloud management dashboards.

## Key Learnings

Today taught me that there's a fundamental difference between reading about programming concepts and actually typing them out and running them. The lunch session gave me exposure to the concepts, but the evening session where I debugged indentation errors and experimented with modifications is what created real understanding.

I learned that indentation errors, while frustrating, are actually teaching me to think about code structure and organization. I learned that experimenting by changing values and observing results is how you build intuition about how code works. Most importantly, I learned that focused practice in short sessions can produce remarkable progress if you're actively engaged rather than passively reading.

## Technical Skills Acquired

- Creating and manipulating Python lists
- Accessing list elements using zero-based indexing
- Using for loops with range to iterate through lists
- Accessing multiple lists simultaneously using index variables
- Implementing conditional logic inside loops with if/else statements
- Tracking running totals and multiple counters during loop execution
- Debugging indentation errors in Python's interactive mode
- Writing formatted output with f-strings for professional reports

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I'll continue building Python fundamentals with a focus on functions and more complex data structures. The goal for the rest of Week 1 is to solidify these programming basics so that when I start hands-on AWS projects in Week 2, I can focus on learning cloud architecture concepts rather than fighting with the code.
